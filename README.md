# Local blockchain for distributed optimization on a local energy community

Test of energy consumption of a local Ethereum blockchain for distributed optimization of energy on a local energy community, containing diverse actors (electric vehicles, PV generators, tertiary loads, storage system).

The smart contract implements a distributed optmization algorithm that enables the actors to find a consensus on the share of the local PV generation. 

The python files are used to implement the behavior of the actor and to automate the exchange with blockchain nodes. In our model, each user holds one node of the blockchain.

We test the implementation with PoA and PoW. 

Tested on March 2021 with Geth under Linux distribution
